        <h1>What is Hawthorn?</h1>
        <p>Hawthorn is an online community named for the Hawthorn tree, known in western herbalism for its heart healing properties, both physical and emotional.</p>
        <p>Hawthorn is a place where anyone can gather to practice open and honest communication with other humans from their communities. This is a safe, cooperative environment premised on mutual support.   Hawthorn is a place where you can find support from others who share similar life experiences to your own, while also developing empathy for those with life experiences adjacent to or completely separate from your own. Hawthorn is a place to be seen, and to see others. Hawthorn is a place to heal and grow.</p>
        <p>Hawthorn is a <a href='https://www.onthecommons.org/work/what-commoning-anyway' target='_blank'>commons</a>, a shared community resource like a library or a park.  Hawthorn is an environment for people to gather, own and direct.  Hawthorn will be made together.</p>
        <p>Hawthorn is based on the concept of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_group' target='_blank'>affinity groups</a>, a group of individuals who come together around a shared experience, interest or common goal. Whether your group starts as friends or strangers, affinity groups often develop into a trusted circle of confidants, people you can go to share a life experience with or engage in facilitated conversation about the topics that are immediately affecting your life.</p>
        <p>With Hawthorn affinity groups, you are free to start or join conversations and share useful resources with people in your community.  Find an awesome community resource in your neighborhood?  Having difficulty navigating something?  Organizing a political action?  Ask for support and share it with the wider community.</p>
        <p>Conversation held within Hawthorn groups are considered confidential and private to the group. Your identity is anonymous by default. You decide what you want to to share about yourself and when. In order to foster a safe space, a moderation process will be in place to counter bad actors and harmful communication.</p>
        <p>Please contact us if you are interested in championing a new affinity group and building community on Hawthorn.</p>

        <h2>Hawthorn is about people, not money</h2>
        <p>Hawthorn is a regenerative enterprise, a cooperative business in the digital space, a platform cooperative.  In short, this means that the users and creators of Hawthorn will own, direct, and govern the platform together.</p>
        <p>This is a socially democratic alternative to the prominent technology business model where a small handful of people own the software platform, the content/data its users produce, and with the primary motivation of making a return on their investment.  Under the cooperative model, if everyone votes to keep their data private and encrypted it will remain private and encrypted; if everyone votes to dramatically change the platform, so it will be.  The motivations of Hawthorn are solely to benefit people and the communities they are a part of.</p>
        <p>The Hawthorn software is open-source.  This means you can transparently see how we built it, and what we are doing with your data. Anyone can contribute to the project to make it better.</p>
        <h2>Help!</h2>
        <p>Interested in assisting to get this off the ground?  Want to facilitate and pilot a new Affinity Group?  Have a great idea for a new Feature?   Something not working the way you think it should?</p>
        <p>Let's talk! We look forward to connecting.</p>
