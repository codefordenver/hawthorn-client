        <h1>What is Hawthorn?</h1>
        <p>Hawthorn is an online community named for the Hawthorn tree, known in western herbalism for its heart healing properties, both physical and emotional.</p>
        <p>Hawthorn is a place where anyone can gather to practice open and honest communication with other humans. This is a safe, cooperative place where you can find support from others who share similar life experiences to your own, while also developing empathy for those with life experiences adjacent to or completely separate from your own.  Hawthorn is a place to be seen, and to see others. Hawthorn is a place to heal.</p>
        <p>Hawthorn is based on the concept of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_group' target='_blank'>affinity groups</a>, a group of individuals who come together around a shared experience, interest or common goal. Whether your group starts as friends or strangers, affinity groups often develop into a trusted circle of confidants, people you can go to share a life experience with or engage in facilitated conversation about the topics that are immediately affecting your life.</p>
        <p>In the initial version of Hawthorn we are piloting two affinity groups:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Parents of Gender-Expansive Children</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Living with Anxiety</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>With Hawthorn affinity groups, <strong>you</strong> are free to join a group if you identify with the group's description and purpose.  You will be paired with 4-5 people who also identify with the description and purpose of the group, and may also represent alternate  life, cultural and global perspective.  This is a group of people you can lean on and develop ongoing conversation with, supporting each other through the journey.</p>
        <p>Conversation held within Hawthorn groups are considered confidential and private to the group.  Your identity is anonymous by default. You decide what you want to to share about yourself and when.  In order to foster a safe space, a moderation process will be in place to counter bad actors and harmful communication.</p>

        <h1>The Hawthorn Story</h1>
        <p>Hawthorn is inspired by an affinity group I’ve been incredibly lucky enough to be a part of in the physical world. Our group was formed during the 2018 Living Communities Design Course in Denver, Colorado through a shared experience: the members all benefit from the privilege of being male-bodied. Since we formed, we have built trust and a support system through shared emotional vulnerability.</p>
        <p>Through my experience working with our group, I have been able to identify, process, and rewrite many troubling stories I have long held about myself, and the people in my life and society as a whole.  I’ve learned how to strengthen my friendships and relationships, how to show up for myself, and how to ask for what I need.  I have been able to discover more of my true self and feel more content and comfortable in my life.  I have built new relationships based on trust and accountability and strengthened my existing relationships.  I have found a sense of community I had not previously known existed, and it has left me wanting more.</p>
        <p>What has been most valuable in the work of our group is having a support system of people I can trust and can be openly vulnerable with. Seeing other people open themselves up has lowered my defenses and, in turn, has allowed me to open up.  This practice of sharing openly and honestly was foreign to me prior to being a part of our group, but now I have a support system that turns to each other in times of need.  It wasn’t until I began an intentional practice of sharing myself, asking for support, and returning the favor that I realized how my practice of stoicism was so petrifying and detrimental. Membership in a group like this has changed my life, and my mission has become facilitating connection and healing through Hawthorn.</p>
        <p>As a parent, a father, and more specifically, the father of a gender expansive child, I see a need for a wider support system in these facets of my life.  Each day I am met with new opportunities and challenges that present themselves in puzzling and trying ways.  I need more support, and everyday I meet other parents, fathers, and parents of gender expansive children who also need more support.  With support and consent from my partner and child, this is my motivation to pilot Hawthorn with the Parents of Gender Expansive Children affinity group.</p>

        <h1>Join the community</h1>
        <h2>Hawthorn is about people, not money</h2>
        <p>Hawthorn is a regenerative enterprise, a cooperative business in the digital space, a platform cooperative.  In short, this means that the users and creators of Hawthorn will own, direct, and govern the platform together.</p>
        <p>This is a socially democratic alternative to the prominent technology business model where a small handful of people own the software platform, the content/data its users produce, and with the primary motivation of making a return on their investment.  Under the cooperative model, if everyone votes to keep their data private and encrypted it will remain private and encrypted; if everyone votes to dramatically change the platform, so it will be.  The motivations of Hawthorn are solely to benefit people and the communities they are a part of.</p>
        <p>The Hawthorn software is open-source.  This means you can transparently see how we built it, and what we are doing with your data. Anyone can contribute to the project to make it better.</p>
        <h2>Help!</h2>
        <p>Interested in assisting to get this off the ground?  Want to facilitate and pilot a new Affinity Group?  Have a great idea for a new Feature?   Something not working the way you think it should?</p>
        <p>Let's talk! We look forward to connecting.</p>
